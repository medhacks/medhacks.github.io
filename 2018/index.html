          Hosted at the nation’s pinnacle center for care, MedHacks is the world’s premier and largest medical hackathon. Join us at the Johns Hopkins Hospital for 36 hours to revolutionize the global state of healthcare.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3 class="top"> Our History </h3>
      <p>
          MedHacks was started in 2014 with the mission to bring together diverse minds from all backgrounds and foster collaboration towards solving the world’s most pressing medical issues.
          In the past three years, MedHacks has grown from 250 to over 750 participants, moved from the Homewood undergraduate campus to the Johns Hopkins Medical Campus, and has established itself as one of the world’s biggest and most recognized medical hackathons.
      </p>
      <p>
          The MedHacks brand has grown into something larger than our flagship medical hackathon with the introduction of 2 new events this spring: (1) Mini-MedHacks: a 1-day medical hackathon for Baltimore city high-school students and (2) The China-U.S HealthTech Forum: bringing together speakers such as Jim Lai, the VP of Tencent, and Lee Chang, the VP of Baidu Ventures, to talk about the global state of healthcare innovations.
      </p>
      <p>
          Join us at MedHacks 2018: Snow Day where we are bringing the largest healthcare & technology companies alongside the Johns Hopkins Medicine Network to revolutionize the way we think about medicine.
      </p>
      <h3> The MedHacks Factor</h3>
      <p>
          We believe that the most pressing medical challenges must be solved by interdisciplinary and diverse teams of people. That's why we don’t care about whether or not you’ve won coding competitions, or even if you’re pursuing an engineering or CS degree. You don’t need a PhD or MD to innovate in healthcare, all you need is a passion for bettering humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
          Last year at MedHacks 2017, we had over 750 hackers for over 300 schools and 15 countries, with diverse majors ranging from public health to biomedical engineering to computer science. We had teams of all ages from undergraduates, to graduates, to medical professionals all coming together with diverse expertise and backgrounds.
      </p>
      <h3> MedHacks 2018: Snow Day </h3>
      <p>
          We’re thrilled to introduce the theme for MedHacks 2018: Snow Day! It’s been a long, exhausting year, and we know that we could all use a day (or three) to relax, not think about school work, huddle up with a computer and some teammates, and focus on innovating healthcare. Even though September in Baltimore is not exactly known for its below-zero temperatures, we’ll be sure to bring the cool within the Johns Hopkins Hospital with our trusty moose, Melvin, by our sides!
      </p>
      <h3> Campus Ambassadors </h3>
      <p>
          We welcome anyone passionate about the MedHacks mission to join our team as a Campus Ambassador. What this entails is spreading the word about MedHacks at your university/city. Campus ambassadors are an integral part of the MedHacks organizing team and receive a guaranteed acceptance to MedHacks, a guaranteed travel reimbursement, and custom swag.
      </p>
      <p>
          We have already sent our first round of acceptances, but if you are from the Toronto, Philadelphia, or Boston area please email <a href="mailto:info@medhacks.org">info@medhacks.org</a> to learn how you can get involved.

    <h2>Tracks</h2>
    <p>
        At MedHacks 2018: Snow Day, you’ll have the choice of choosing a project within our three tracks. The hack you decide to do must fall within the track that you choose and you will be judged within your track for a track-specific prize. The three tracks from MedHacks 2017 were Medication Adherence with CVS Health, Patient Safety & Quality with Hopkins Medicine, and Access to Care with Blue Cross Blue Shield.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stay tuned for an announcement of tracks for MedHacks 2018!

        </h2>
        <h3 class="top">The Application Process</h3>
        <p>
            MedHacks receives thousands of applications from talented and diverse people all around the world every year, but unfortunately we don’t have the space to accommodate everyone who who like to attend.
        </p>
        <p>
            MedHacks prides itself on being accessible for all students, especially those without any kind of computing background, and so we try as hard as possible to reflect that in the population of participants at the event. We encourage all individuals interested in the fields of medicine and innovation to apply, regardless of skill level. We’d love to have you!
        </p>
        <p>
            We follow a rolling application basis, so the earlier you apply, the more likely you’ll be able to be accepted! General applications will be closing tentatively August 15th at 11:59PM.
        </p>
        <h3>The Application Portal</h3>
        <p>
            This year, in order to streamline the application process, our talented team of developers have developed an application portal. Once you create an account you can submit an application, view the status of your application and view any resources.
        </p>
        <h3>Travel Reimbursements</h3>
        <p>
            If you are interested in receiving a travel reimbursement, you must indicate this on your application. We will then be sending out travel reimbursement applications to those that have indicated it on their application. You will then have until July 15th to apply for a travel reimbursement. We offer reimbursements in $50, $100, $250 increments depending on where you are coming from. If you are coming from a school with a lot of hackers, we may send a bus on a case-by-case basis.

              <p>

              </p>
              <p>
                  If you’re a graduate student or professional, you can choose to join MedHacks either as a participant or as a mentor!

              <h3>How can I get a travel reimbursement?</h3>
                  <p>
                      If you are accepted and remarked on your application that you would need a travel reimbursement, you may be invited to apply for a travel reimbursement. In that case, sign into the MedHacks application portal and follow the links for the travel reimbursement application.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Once you are accepted for a reimbursement, you must submit a VALID receipt. Guidelines for valid receipts are here. Your reimbursement is contingent upon your submitting a valid receipt. Failure to do so will result in MedHacks’ inability to issue said reimbursement.
