                <p>Join us at MedHacks 2020, where we are bringing the largest healthcare & technology companies in
                    collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Medicine Network to revolutionize the way we think about

                <p>MedHacks was started in 2015 with the mission to bring together talented and diverse minds from all
                    backgrounds and foster collaboration towards solving the world’s most pressing medical issues.</p>
                <p>In the past three years, MedHacks has been attended by thousands from over 500 institutions and 30
                    countries, has formed partnerships with companies at the forefront of medicine and technology
                    including
                    Blue Cross Blue Shield, CVS Health, Google, and KPCB, and has established itself as one of the
                    world’s
                    most recognized and influential medical hackathons.</p>
                <p>The MedHacks brand has grown into something larger than our flagship medical hackathon with the
                    introduction of 2 new events this spring: (1) Mini-MedHacks: a 1-day medical hackathon for Baltimore
                    city high-school students and (2) The China-U.S HealthTech Forum: bringing together speakers such as
                    Jim
                    Lai, the VP of Tencent, and Lee Chang, the VP of Baidu Ventures, to talk about the global state of
                    healthcare innovations.</p>

                <h3>The MedHacks Factor</h3>
                <p>We believe that the most pressing medical challenges must be solved by interdisciplinary and diverse
                    teams of
                    people. We don’t care about whether or not you’ve won coding competitions, or even if you’re
                    pursuing an
                    engineering or CS degree. You don’t need a PhD or MD to innovate in healthcare, all you need is a
                    passion
                    for bettering humanity.</p>

                <p>Last year at MedHacks 2019, we hosted over [NUMBER] hackers with diverse majors ranging from public
                    health to
                    anthropology to computer science. We had participants of all ages, including undergraduates,
                    graduate
                    students, MD students, nursing students, and medical professionals, come together with their diverse
                    expertise and backgrounds to solve problems.</p>
