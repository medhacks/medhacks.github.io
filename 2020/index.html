                Due to the current circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the MedHacks organizing team has
                decided that it would be in everyone’s best
                interest to move the 2020 hackathon onto an online platform. The event will be held virtually from
                September 4, 2020 to September 6, 2020.
                Applications are now closed for non-JHU applicants. The application deadline for JHU applicants is 8/31.
                We are looking forward to seeing what exciting ideas
                everyone has in an effort to improve the quality of medical care!

                        At MedHacks 2020, we are bringing together the largest healthcare & technology companies in
                        collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Medicine Network to revolutionize the way we think about
                        medicine. Join us this September underwater with our new mascot, Odette the otter, and our

                    <p>
                        MedHacks was started in 2015 by undergraduate students at Johns Hopkins University with the
                        mission to bring together talented and diverse minds from all backgrounds and to foster
                        collaboration towards solving the world’s most pressing medical issues.
                        To this day, MedHacks is completely run by undergraduate students at Johns Hopkins University
                        who have dedicated countless hours to making this
                        hackathon as exciting and rewarding as possible for all participants, mentors, and sponsors.
                        MedHacks has been attended by thousands from over 500 institutions and 30 countries, has formed
                        partnerships with companies at the forefront of medicine and technology including Blue Cross
                        Blue Shield, CVS Health, Google, and KPCB, and has established itself as one of the world’s most
                        recognized and influential medical hackathons.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe that the most pressing medical challenges must be solved by interdisciplinary and
                        diverse teams of people. We don’t care about whether or not you’ve won coding competitions, or
                        even if you’re pursuing an engineering or CS degree. You don’t need a PhD or MD to innovate in
                        healthcare, all you need is a passion for bettering humanity.
                        Throughout the years, MedHacks has hosted hackers with diverse majors ranging from public health
                        to anthropology to computer science. We have had participants of all ages, including
                        undergraduates, graduate students, MD students, nursing students, and medical professionals,
                        come together with their diverse expertise and backgrounds to solve problems. We can’t wait to
                        see you and your ideas at MedHacks 2020!

            <p class="subtext">
                MedHacks receives thousands of applications from talented and diverse people all around the world every
                year, but unfortunately we don’t have the space to accommodate everyone who would like to attend.
                MedHacks prides itself on being accessible for all students, especially those without any kind of
                computing
                background, and so we try as hard as possible to reflect that in the population of participants at the
                event. We encourage all individuals interested in any (or all!) of the fields of medicine, technology,
                and
                entrepreneurship to apply. We’d love to have you!

                developed an
                application portal for participants. Once you create an account you can submit an application, view the status of your
                application and view any resources.

            <p class="subtext">
                We are looking for talented and qualified professionals in tech, entrepreneurship, medicine, and their intersection to act as mentors and judges for MedHacks. New this year, we are offering the opportunity to present workshops and host Q&A sessions on topics of your choice! Traditional engagement of mentors has also included ad hoc Q&A over Slack/Discord channels. If there is mutual interest, we also can match mentors to specific teams for personalized mentorship throughout the event. Mentors can be involved in 1st round judging of demos, an exciting way to take in all the amazing projects that come out of the event.

                        A hackathon is a place where people learn, play, and make. A hackathon is where people perform
                        superhuman feats and solve problems in short periods of time. Hackathons are likely the most
                        exciting thing you don't know too much about.
                        But more broadly defined, a hackathon is a multi-day event where people come together, ideate,
                        and work intensively on ideas and products.

                        MedHacks is a student-run event that focuses on innovating at the crossroads of medical
                        entrepreneurship and technological development.
                        <br> <br>
                        By working together for the weekend, hackers at MedHacks will gain unique opportunities to learn
                        from each other and from experts at the forefront of medicine and technology – integrating their
                        learning into real solutions to pressing medical challenges.

                    <p>
                        Any student, anywhere. Anyone can make an impact - hackathons produce "hackers", not the other
                        way around. Students - both at the undergraduate and graduate level - with engineering, medical,
                        and entrepreneurial backgrounds are encouraged to apply for a spot at MedHacks 2020, as long as they are at least 18 years old.

                        If you don't know about health or engineering, don’t worry - learning is a huge part of the
                        MedHacks experience. We will have workshops on all subjects and mentors to answer questions and
                        help out teams. Come with an open mind, you'll work with a great team, learn a lot, and most
                        importantly, have fun!

                        Of course! We are looking for talented and qualified mentors, speakers, and sponsors in tech,
                        entrepreneurship, medicine, and their intersection. We're always looking for new people to get
                        involved, so shoot us an email at info@medhacks.io and we'll be in touch. </p>

                        We are still planning on offering the same perks that we have in previous MedHacks events, such
                        as fun games, workshops, speakers, social media activities, mentorship, and merch. However, all
                        communication will be conducted on a virtual platform. Details regarding day-of-event logistics
                        will be sent out to all participants closer to the event. Other than that, nothing about the
                        event really changes! Good news: you’ll get to sleep in your own bed, shower in your own home,
                        eat home-cooked meals, and you don’t have to pay for travel!

                        We will set up channels for communication within tracks and moderate pitch sessions for you to
                        meet potential teammates, but you are also welcome to use other modes of communication with
                        other participants once you decide to form a team.
