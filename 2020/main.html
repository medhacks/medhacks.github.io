                Due to the current circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, the MedHacks organizing team has decided that it would be in everyone’s best 
                interest to move the 2020 hackathon onto an online platform. The event will be held virtually from September 4, 2020 to September 6, 2020. 
                Applications for MedHacks 2020 are currently open and will close on August 15, 2020. 
                While we are disappointed that we are unable to host our event as usual this year, we are looking forward to seeing what exciting ideas 
                everyone has in an effort to improve the quality of medical care!

                        30
                        countries, has formed partnerships with companies at the forefront of medicine and technology
                        including
                        Blue Cross Blue Shield, CVS Health, Google, and KPCB, and has established itself as one of the

                MedHacks receives thousands of applications from talented and diverse people all around the world every
                year, but unfortunately we don’t have the space to accommodate everyone who would like to attend.
                MedHacks prides itself on being accessible for all students, especially those without any kind of
                computing
                background, and so we try as hard as possible to reflect that in the population of participants at the
                event. We encourage all individuals interested in any (or all!) of the fields of medicine, technology,
                and
                entrepreneurship to apply. We’d love to have you!

Other than that, nothing about the event really changes! Good news: you’ll get to sleep in your own bed, shower in your own home, eat home-cooked meals, and you don’t have to pay for travel!

                        A hackathon is a place where people learn, play, and make. A hackathon is where people perform superhuman feats and solve problems in short periods of time. Hackathons are likely the most exciting thing you don't know too much about.
                        But more broadly defined, a hackathon is a multi-day event where people come together, ideate, and work intensively on ideas and products.

                        Any student, anywhere. Anyone can make an impact - hackathons produce "hackers", not the other way around. Students - both at the undergraduate and graduate level - with engineering, medical, and entrepreneurial backgrounds are encouraged to apply for a spot at MedHacks 2020.
