        is a critical care physician, trauma surgeon, retired Navy commander and
        biomedical engineer. His research has been revolutionizing the field of
        prosthetics, which was motivated by observing the destruction of war and
        the countless lives forever altered through the loss of limbs. This
        journey led him to become one of the nation’s leading experts in
        developing advanced, inexpensive prosthetics using 3D printing
        technology. This technology has served children with upper extremity
        congenital limb loss and the development of a 3D-printed exoskeleton for
        individuals that have experienced stroke. In the face of the recent
        COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Chi’s lab created a 3D-printed ventilator capable
        of basic and advanced support with the goal of providing a technology
        accessible and effective to any community that needed it.
