      q: "What is a hackathon?",
      a: "A hackathon is a place where people learn, play, and create. A hackathon is where people perform superhuman feats and solve problems in short periods of time. Hackathons are likely the most exciting thing you don't know too much about. But more broadly defined, a hackathon is a multi-day event where people come together, ideate, and work intensively on ideas and products.",
