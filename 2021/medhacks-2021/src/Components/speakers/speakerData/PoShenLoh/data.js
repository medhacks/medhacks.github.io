        Po-Shen Loh is a social entrepreneur, working across the full spectrum
        of mathematics and education, all around the world. He is a math
        professor at Carnegie Mellon University and the national coach of the #1
        ranked USA International Mathematical Olympiad team. Loh pioneered the
        first COVID-19 anonymous contact tracing app, NOVID, which uses
        ultrasound for proximity detection, circumventing the intrinsic
        inaccuracy of Bluetooth-based measurements. NOVID has been featured by
        publications including TechCrunch, Wired, Forbes, and The New Yorker.
