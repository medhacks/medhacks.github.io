We don’t care about whether or not you’ve won coding competitions, or even if you’re pursuing an engineering or CS degree. You don’t need a PhD or MD to innovate in healthcare, all you need is a passion for bettering humanity.
We have hosted hackers with diverse majors ranging from public health to anthropology to computer science. We have had participants of all ages, including undergraduates, graduate students, MD students, nursing students, and medical professionals, come together with their diverse expertise and backgrounds to solve problems. For 36 hours, these hackers will bring their ideas to fruition. At the end of the event, they will have the opportunity to present their solutions to the judges and the world.</p>

            <p>A hackathon is a place where people learn, play, and make. A hackathon is where people perform superhuman feats and solve problems in short periods of time. Hackathons are likely the most exciting thing you don't know too much about.</p>
            <p>But more broadly defined, a hackathon is a multi-day event where people come together, ideate, and work intensively on ideas and products.</p>
